# IMPORTANT: HOW TO USE i2scim GITHUB ISSUES

Github issues SHOULD ONLY BE USED to report bugs, and for DETAILED feature
requests. For everything else feel free to use [github discussions](https://github.com/i2-open/i2scim/discussions).

PLEASE DO NOT POST GENERAL QUESTIONS that are not about bugs or suspected
bugs in the Github issues system. We'll be very happy to help you and provide
all the support in the discussion area.

# How to provide a patch for a new feature

1. If it is a major feature or a semantical change, please don't start coding
   straight away: if your feature is not a conceptual fit you'll lose a lot of
   time writing the code without any reason. Start by posting in the Github discussions area
   and/or creating an issue at Github with the description of, exactly, what you want
   to accomplish and why. Use cases are important for features to be accepted.
   Here you'll see if there is consensus about your idea.

2. If in step 1 you get an acknowledgment from the project leaders, use the
   following procedure to submit a patch:

   a. Fork i2scim on github ( https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo )
   b. Create a topic branch (git checkout -b my_branch)
   c. Push to your branch (git push origin my_branch)
   d. Initiate a pull request on github ( https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request )
   e. Done :)

3. Keep in mind that issues and PRs sometimes wait
   for a *very* long time. However this is not lack of interest, as the project
   gets more and more users, we find ourselves in a constant need to prioritize
   certain issues/PRs over others. If you think your issue/PR is very important
   try to popularize it, have other users commenting and sharing their point of
   view and so forth. This helps.

4. For minor fixes just open a pull request on Github.

Thanks!
